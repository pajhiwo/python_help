# Object Oriented Programming

* **TODO**: check or/and combine with `Inheritance_Composition`

## Encapsulation
Hide internal representation or state of an object, so it is not visible by other external objects.
By keeping attributes private and only allowing access to them via _getter_ and _setter_ methods, we hide specific information and restrict access to the internal state

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows us to define methods in the child class with the same name as defined in their parent class -> Method Overriding

## Inheritance

## Abstraction

## Composition
