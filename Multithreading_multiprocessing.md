## Multithreading and multiprocessing
### Process

A process is an instance of a computer program being executed. Each process has its own memory space it uses to store the instructions being run, as well as any data it needs to store and access to execute.

### Threads

Threads are components of a process, which can run parallely. There can be multiple threads in a process, and they share the same memory space, i.e. the memory space of the parent process. This would mean the code to be executed as well as all the variables declared in the program would be shared by all threads.
