## Single responsibility principle
(SRP) states that every class or module in a program should have responsibility for just a single piece of that programâ€™s functionality

## Open/Closed Principle 
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle 
No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use - split interfaces to smaller specific ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
1.  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).
2.  Abstractions should not depend on details. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
