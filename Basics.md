## Python:

-   **Interpreted language**.
    
-   Python does not need to be compiled before it is run
    
-   **Dynamically typed**, this means that you don't need to state the types of variables
    
-   **Functions are first-class objects**. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects
    
-   Everything is an object. String “123” is an object. There are no primitives in python.
    
-   Python **memory** is **managed by python private heap space**
    
-   Python has **inbuilt garbage collector**
    
-   PEP8 - coding convention
